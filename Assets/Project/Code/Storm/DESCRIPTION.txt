namespace Storm {

  This is the root namespace. Everything except for the GameManager Singleton should go in a sub namespace.

  Namespaces that have the word "System" in them refer to more complex code that requires a Manager of some kind to track state.

  Otherwise, the namespaces are used to organize related code.
