0_Common:
  This folder contains prefabs, assets, and scenes that are common to parts of the mainframe
  gameplay. If you have an assets that are shared between both the overworld and the mainframe,
  they go in Project/Common/ instead.

Other Folders:
  Prefabs, scenes, and assets specific to that mainframe level. Each area's subfolder
  is organized like so:
  
    0_Prefabs:
      Prefabricated parts that are reusable between scenes.
    1_BaseScenes:
      Template scenes that can be duplicated and renamed for a quick start to a new mainframe
      level scene.
    2_Scenes:
      The actual scenes of the level.
    Assets:
      The art, animation, sound, etc., involved in making the above prefabs and scenes. 
      
    ***REMEMBER***
    Anything that's shared between two mainframe levels should go in Project/Mainframe/Common instead.
