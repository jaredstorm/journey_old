0_Common:
  This folder contains prefabs, assets, and scenes that are common to parts of the overworld
  gameplay. If you have an assets that are shared between both the overworld and the mainframe,
  they go in Project/Common/ instead.

Other Folders:
  Prefabs, scenes, and assets specific to that particular area in the overworld. Each area's subfolder
  is organized like so:
  
    0_Prefabs:
      Prefabricated parts that are reusable between scenes.
    1_BaseScenes:
      Template scenes that can be duplicated and renamed for a quick start to a new level specific to
      that area.
    2_Scenes:
      The actual scenes of the area.
    Assets:
      The art, animation, sound, etc., involved in making the above prefabs and scenes. 
      
    ***REMEBER***
    Anything that's shared between two areas of the overworld should go in Project/Overworld/Common/ instead.
