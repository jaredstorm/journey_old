STRUCTURE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Code:
  All of the project's source code. 
  Monobehaviors, state, and the like. Subfolders should mirror namespaces.

Prep:
  Reserved for highly volotile or experimental development. 
  If it's likely to change in the next 2 weeks or so, it goes here.

Prefabs:
  Prefabricated GameObjects that you can drag and drop into a level.

BaseScenes:
  These scenes have the basic game objects and managers needed to run the game and start building levels quickly.
  Be sure to duplicate these before you start making changes!

Finished:
  Finished segments of the game. Stuff you're not as likely to touch again.
