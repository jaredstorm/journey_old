Code:
  All of the project's source code. 
  Monobehaviors, state, and the like. Folders should mirror namespaces

  Prefabs, scenes, and other assets that are common between the overworld AND 
  mainframe gameplay sequences.

Mainframe:
  Prefabs, scenes, and other assets that are specific to just mainframe 
  gameplay sequences.

Overworld:
  Prefabs, scenes, and other assets that are specific to the 
  overworld's gameplay.

Prep:
  Reserved for highly volotile or experimental development. 
   If it's likely to change in the 30 days or so, it goes here.
